This trigger and trigger function combination ensures that whenever a new row is inserted into the `brt.passenger_booked_trips` table, the corresponding `brt.scheduled_trips` row's `current_trip_cap` is incremented by `1`, and the `trip_status` is updated based on the current trip capacity. This allows the `brt.scheduled_trips` table to reflect the number of booked passengers and the trip status accurately.
